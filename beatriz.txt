look,
could she be young,
could she be sad,
could it not be?
could it be paint
the actress' face (the face of the actress)

if she dances in the seventh heaven
if she believes she is someplace else
if she simply plays her part
and could I be a part of it? (of her life)

look,
could it be china,
could it be ether
could it be madness,
could it be scenery
the actress' house (abode? nah)

if she lives in a skyscraper,
and if the walls are made of chalk,
and if she cries in a hotel room,
and could I be part of her life? (of it)

take me away for good my beatriz,
teach me not to walk touching the ground,
forevers happen narrowly
ah, tell me of the woes you see within my hands,
say we run the risk of living happily

look,
could it be a star
could it be a farce
could it be comedic
could it be divine the life of the actress
what if she falls from heaven suddenly
and if the public asks for an encore
and if an angel goes passing the hat
and could I be part of her life?
